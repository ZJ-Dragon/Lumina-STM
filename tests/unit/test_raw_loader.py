Unit‑tests for RawLoader
========================
Goals
-----
1. Assert black‑level subtraction – the minimum pixel value after loading
   should be ~0 (tolerance 1e‑3).  A sample RAW containing a grey card that
   is deliberately under‑exposed is placed in `tests/assets/`.
2. Assert the packed tensor shape is (H/2, W/2, 4) and dtype float32.
3. Assert all pixel values are within [0, 1].

If the sample RAW is missing (e.g. CI without large binary assets) the
tests will be skipped automatically.
